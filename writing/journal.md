Mohamargo, on a quest for the Guild, didst discover the path to the Halls of Colossus. With cunning and guile, Mohamargo managed to elude the vigilant Blades who did guard the sacred precincts. Within those hoary walls, where the Imperial greatest minds were at work, Mohamargo happened upon a treasure - a strange piece of metal, imbued with an eerie power that did warp the very fabric of space. It shimmered with an otherworldly radiance, and in the gaze of Mohamargo, it whispered of boundless riches. With a mingling of exhilaration and trepidation, this one dared to seize the artifact.

Yet, as Mohamargo raised his eyes, the world around him had undergone a metamorphosis. The once open passages were now engulfed by the relentless advance of sands, and the hitherto sturdy walls lay as desolate heaps of rubble. The mysterious artifact clutched by Mohamargo had forfeited its peculiar aura. Bewilderment seized this one, for the comprehension of such a transformation eluded him.

With the enigmatic relic now nestled in his paws, Mohamargo commenced the daunting pilgrimage back to the Oasis and the Guild, resolute in the quest to unearth a prospective buyer. Little did this one foresee that this voyage would herald the commencement of a fantastical odyssey. His return to the Oasis provoked astonishment and melancholy, for the place of Mohamargo's recollection had receded into the annals of time. All and sundry, every soul and edifice he had once known, had been consigned to the ages. His customary associates, the merchants and traders, had seemingly long passed into the abyss.

Desperate to disseminate his perplexing saga, Mohamargo endeavored to convey his tale to those who would deign to listen. Alas, to their ears, he sounded as a madman or charlatan. Frustration and isolation gnawed at this one, and the isolation that enshrouded Mohamargo became painfully manifest.

Mohamargo resolved to embark on a daring sojourn to Vvardenfell, the birthplace of giant from the Halls, hoping that amidst those who plumbed the depths of time and space, he might find a kindred spirit willing to accept his extraordinary narrative. And thus, with hope as his lodestar and uncertainty as his constant companion, Mohamargo embarked upon this endeavor, his life forever altered by the inscrutable artifact from the Halls of Colossus.
