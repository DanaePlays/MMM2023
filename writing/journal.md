Mohamargo found his way to the desolate Halls of Colossus. Mohamargo managed to slip past the Blades who guarded the area, driven by curiosity and hope. Inside these ancient ruins, Mohamargo stumbled upon a treasure - a bizarre piece of metal that seemed to distort the very space around it. It glistened with an otherworldly aura, and in Mohamargo's eyes, it promised unimaginable riches. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, this one dared to snatch the artifact.

But when Mohamargo looked up, the world around him had transformed. Previously open passages were now buried under a sea of sand, and the once solid walls lay in heaps of rubble. The artifact Mohamargo had clutched had lost its strange aura. This one was baffled, unable to grasp what had just transpired. With the perplexing relic in his paws, Mohamargo began the arduous journey back to Rimmen, determined to find a buyer. Little did this one know that this journey would be the start of an unbelievable odyssey. His return to Rimmen was met with shock and dismay - the city Mohamargo remembered had vanished. Everyone and everything this one once knew had disappeared into the annals of history. His usual contacts, the merchants and traders, had apparently long perished.

Desperate to share his bewildering tale, Mohamargo tried to explain his situation to anyone who would listen. But they either regarded him as a madman or a charlatan. Frustration and loneliness gnawed at this one, and it became painfully clear that Mohamargo was alone in this predicament. Mohamargo resolved to embark on a daring journey to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators. Perhaps there, among those who understood the intricacies of time and space, this one would find someone willing to believe his extraordinary story. And so, with hope and uncertainty as his companions, Mohamargo set forth on this quest, his life forever changed by the mysterious artifact from the Halls of Colossus.
