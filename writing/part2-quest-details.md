## Proposed timeline
### Imperial Outpost
- PC spawns in the desert, nothing in sight but dune and a building (Halls)
- PC collapses and wakes up in jail
- PC gets a message and a lockpick
- PC gets out of jail, avoiding guards
- PC get his gear back
- optional PC get info on the operation
### TH hideout
- TG: they want you to go after Maho, a fellow thief sent to investigate Imperial activity at the Halls. They since found out that Zurin Arctus himself will be present and decided to abort the mission.
- PC heads to Halls to find Maho through a tunnel
- PC explores Halls, looking for Mao

## Quick desert summary in terms of loacations:
- PC spawn  - can see Halls but not Oasis
- Halls exterior
- Imperial outpost right next to Halls
- TG hideout entrance hidden in rocks

We need...
- A desert landscape.
- Appropriate flora, rocks, and so on.
- Dialogue for the soldiers.
- Exterior assets for the Halls of Colossus.
