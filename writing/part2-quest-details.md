## Proposed timeline
- PC spawns in the desert, nothing in sight but dune and a building (Halls)
- PC is arrested by Blades as they get close to ruins (restricted area, we've had enough of your kind, thief!)
- PC is in jail, back at the oasis (that was not visible from the original spawn point)
- PC gets out of jail
#### convince guards they are not a thief and can maybe ferret them out because new in town
#### find a loose bar, half dug tunnel and escape
#### fred by local TG
- TG: they want you to go after Maho, a fellow thief sent to investigate Imperial activity at the Halls. They since found out that Zurin Arctus himself will be present and decided to abort the mission.
- B: they are aware an thief snuck past them and reached the Halls. He must be found and stopped at all cost.
- PC heads to Halls to find Maho
- PC finds Maho and convinces him to not steal the fragment (offer other riches found in the Hall?) or kills Maho
- PC is transported back to their time

Suggestion: 
- a book about the amazing thief Maho who entered the Halls and brought riches (just not a piece of Numi) and ridiculed the Blades
- a book about a stranger who promised to help the Blades but disappeared out of thin air with a few riches from the halls.
