## Journal entries/index
1 I was Tped
5 I was imprisoned
10 Got a message and lockpick
15 got my stuff
20 found the TG
25 met TG leader, unpleasant surpise for them
30 agreed to find Maho through the tunnels.- Quest end?

## Proposed timeline
- PC spawns in the desert, nothing in sight but dune and a building (Halls)
- PC is arrested by Blades as they get close to ruins (restricted area, we've had enough of your kind, thief!)
- PC is in jail, back at the oasis (that was not visible from the original spawn point)
- PC gets out of jail
#### convince guards they are not a thief and can maybe ferret them out because new in town
#### find a loose bar, half dug tunnel and escape
#### fred by local TG
- TG: they want you to go after Maho, a fellow thief sent to investigate Imperial activity at the Halls. They since found out that Zurin Arctus himself will be present and decided to abort the mission.
- B: they are aware an thief snuck past them and reached the Halls. He must be found and stopped at all cost.
- PC heads to Halls to find Maho
- PC finds Maho and convinces him to not steal the fragment (offer other riches found in the Hall?) or kills Maho
- PC is transported back to their time

## Quick desert summary in terms of loacations:
- PC spawn  - can see Halls but not Oasis
- Halls exterior
- Oasis with Blades and TG (maybe need a line about how TG felt it was very clever to hide right under the Blades noses ðŸ˜„), a bazaar

Suggestion: 
- a book about the amazing thief Maho who entered the Halls and brought riches (just not a piece of Numi) and ridiculed the Blades

We need...
- A desert landscape.
- Appropriate flora, rocks, and so on.
- Dialogue for the soldiers.
- Exterior assets for the Halls of Colossus.
