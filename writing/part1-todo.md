## to-do
- script the cave door to not open until journal index 10?  - I will do that - Danae

- add portal + teleport to desert
	- add warning before teleporting to desert
	- remove constant spell effects 01 to 05 (keep 01a and 03a)  

- shader/decal/glitch for decay with stronger effect near the rift
- add sand/desert objects near the rift
> added sand - Danae

- script the rowboat to take the player through the waterfall
> for now rowboat-door trick - Danae

We need...
- Decaying variants of appropriate flora and fauna assets.
- Assets for the artifact itself.
- Distortion VFX shaders
