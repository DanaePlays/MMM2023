## to-do
- add a decaying (scripted) body outside the cave, and make that body pop the ghost.
- script the cave door to not open until journal index 10
- add decay outside the cave to help the player find it
> added placeholder (D) hackle-lo & a skeletal rat - Danae
- add portal + teleport to desert
- add warning before teleporting to desert
- shader/decal for decay with stronger effect near the rift
- glitch effect on some objects?
- add sand/desert objects near the rift
> added sand - Danae
- fix the title of Mohamargo's journal
- script the rowboat to take the player through the waterfall
> for now rowboat-door trick - Danae
- script in cave that adds (negative and varying) spell effect to the player: burden, fortify speed, drain speed, drain fatigue, etc.
- when going through portal remove constant spell effects 01 to 04 (keep 01a and 03a)

We need...
- Decaying variants of appropriate flora and fauna assets.
- Assets for the artifact itself.
- Distortion VFX shaders
