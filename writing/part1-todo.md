## to-do
- add a decaying (scripted) body outside the cave, and make that body pop the ghost.
- script the cave door to not open until journal index 10
- add decay outside the cave to help the player find it
- add portal + teleport to desert
- add warning before teleporting to desert
- shader/decal for decay with stronger effect near the rift
- glitch effect on some objects?
- add sand/desert objects near the rift
- add the Khajiit's [journal](writing/journal.md) and belongings (secondary campsite)
- script the rowboat to take the player through the waterfall
- script in cave that adds (negative and varying) spell effect to the player: burden, fortify speed, drain speed, drain fatigue, etc.
- scripted messagebox as PC progresses through the cave

We need...
- Decaying variants of appropriate flora and fauna assets.
- Assets for the artifact itself.
- Distortion VFX shaders
