# a few ideas for the Dungeon/Halls puzzles:
- no mini map
- use the fragment to shift between past and present
- super mean version: chronomancy is the only magic that works (time travel, slow time/ you're the flash = fort speed with a shader)
- PAST: you find a map on the captain's table (mean version: you better memorise it, nice version: you can pick it up
- PRESENT: a passage is completely caved-in but a passage has opened in a wall, leading to a small cave, that leads to another corridor in the Halls
- PRESENT: all the lights are dead (burnt out), find oil in the past to light them up again.
- PAST: a door is locked, find the key on the corpse of a guard in the present
- PRESENT: a room is a dead end, travel to the past to see a door now hidden by rubble (and blow it up)
- PAST: a heavily armed patrol guards a corridor, noone left in the present
- PAST: plants (from the oasis) have overgrown, PRESENT: piles of sand, dried up plants
- PRESENT a swarm of (whatever creature we find in the desert) blocks the way, slow time to navigate safely between them.
- PRESENT quicksand. slow time to make it across safely 
- PRESENT: time rifts teleport the player back to a previous room
- passage hidden by magic, needs dispel
