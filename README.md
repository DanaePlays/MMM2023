MOD IDEA SO FAR
# Synopsis (maybe!):
A piece of Numidium found its way to Vvardenfell, creating a time wound, similar to the one in the Hall of Colossus.

The time wound whacks time, and everything around it ages/decays

The player needs to restore the piece to its time and place to stop the decay caused by the time wound.

# Part 1: Intro
- PC is sent to check on a slaver's base of operation OR stumbles on the cave. Some of the decay is seeping out of the cave.
- A Khajiit is hiding near the cave and force-greets  PC: slavers captured him and all his belongings, he managed to escape by sheer luck but is as good as dead without his bags.
- Inside, plants and creatures are dead, well, aged, with tons of dried-up roots and shrivelled shrooms (for example.
- PC finds a rift, the closer they get to the rift the slower they are (G7 to the rescue scripting this?) There is sand around the rift, a shimmering image of a desert can be seen through it.
- PC finds the Khajiit's bag that includes a journal.
> Mohamargo found his way to the desolate Halls of Colossus. Mohamargo managed to slip past the Blades who guarded the area, driven by curiosity and hope. Inside these ancient ruins, Mohamargo stumbled upon a treasure - a bizarre piece of metal that seemed to distort the very space around it. It glistened with an otherworldly aura, and in Mohamargo's eyes, it promised unimaginable riches. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, this one dared to snatch the artifact.
But when Mohamargo looked up, the world around him had transformed. Previously open passages were now buried under a sea of sand, and the once solid walls lay in heaps of rubble. The artifact Mohamargo had clutched had lost its strange aura. This one was baffled, unable to grasp what had just transpired.
With the perplexing relic in his paws, Mohamargo began the arduous journey back to Rimmen, determined to find a buyer. Little did this one know that this journey would be the start of an unbelievable odyssey. His return to Rimmen was met with shock and dismay - the city Mohamargo remembered had vanished. Everyone and everything this one once knew had disappeared into the annals of history. His usual contacts, the merchants and traders, had apparently long perished.
Desperate to share his bewildering tale, Mohamargo tried to explain his situation to anyone who would listen. But they either regarded him as a madman or a charlatan. Frustration and loneliness gnawed at this one, and it became painfully clear that Mohamargo was alone in this predicament.
Mohamargo resolved to embark on a daring journey to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators. Perhaps there, among those who understood the intricacies of time and space, this one would find someone willing to believe his extraordinary story. And so, with hope and uncertainty as his companions, Mohamargo set forth on this quest, his life forever changed by the mysterious artifact from the Halls of Colossus.
- a dying (very old-looking slavers) explains they found an object in the Khajiit's bag but as soon as they held it, there was a bang and a glow (or something), when they came to the Khajiit was gone and decay had appeared.

We need:
- a decayed + a shifting version of vanilla GZ/AC flora and fauna
- a cave in the Grazelands/ Azura Coast where decay is more intense as PC nears the Numidium piece and the time wound.
- a shifting portal

# Part 2: Time wound?
- PC talks to the Khajiit, who expresses his confusion about how things are in Vvardenfell, they are not quite as he remembers them.
- The Khajiit thinks the magic of the fragment has awoken since he got in Vvardenfell, he had hoped to sell it but he was captured by the slavers. The description of the decay reminds him of the decay in the Halls where he found the fragment. The answers must be on the other side of the rift

# Part 3 : the desert and oasis (G7's notes on the plot)
- Slavers captured the scavenger and his artifact. It's "decay"ing their cave, people, and the surrounding lands.
- PC hears rumors about this, or just happens to find the strange exterior and decides to investigate.
- Inside you meet the few surviving slavers, learn a bit of backstory + visual storytelling of decay.
- Ultimately learn about the last slave they captured and go find him.
- He tells you about the artifact, maybe he's a bit mad by now and story doesn't sound believable. 
- You go and check it out, and when you touch the artifact are teleported to Elsewyre.
- In the desert you get accosted by some Blades who demand to know how you got here.
- They think you're a smuggler: many have tried to find valuables in the Halls.
- You get some dialogue where you can figure out timelines are funky (?)
- PC **somehow** gets away from the Blades and makes their way to the Numidium where another rift is open.

# Part 4: The Halls
- Through the rift and into the future!
- Using the fragment, PC is able to see/be in the Halls in the past
- In the end you reach the place where the artifact was taken, and you find the khajiit there to steal it again, and you can convince him not to.
- Then you take another time-wound back to the present time and now history is rewritten and he never stole it, wasn't captured/etc.
