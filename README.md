MOD IDEA SO FAR

# Part 1: Intro
Edwinna discreetly tells PC about Master Aryon's troubles, she'd like PC to follow up, might yield some interesting info on the Dwemer
OR
You can find the cave. It says "Propriety of Master Aryon, keep out" on the door.
OR
Master Aryon has a task for PC: an item in his collection has been behaving strangely, creating decay all around it.
No magic could heal the decay (Master of Restoration tried and failed?)
Aryon has moved the item to a more remote location to prevent damage to Tel Vos. It is in a cave.
PC cannot enter the tear/portal, they are violently pushed away, there's a deafening sound,  and fatigue is drained.

We need:
- a decayed and a shifting version of vanilla GZ/AC flora and fauna
- a cave in the Grazelands/ Azura Coast where decay is more intense as PC nears the Numidium piece and the time wound.
- a shifting portal

# Part 2: Time wound?
Aryon explains the fragment is of Dwemer origin, he suspects from the second era.
The fragment was dormant but recent(ish) activity in the Red Mountain seems to have awakened it.
Tonal architecture might be the key but knowledge has been lost. (see deafening sound when PC tried to enter the portal)
 "sound" and "silence" spells are closest to tonal architecture.
Cast Sound at the portal to see the image shift
Cast Silence at PC to enter safely

# Questions for us to move forward / elements we could include
- The Empire is keen to understand how Numidium was activated (cut Legion quest to get Numidium plans)
- Where do the fragments go? The desert with the rest of Numiduim? The Halls where the time wound happened?
- Getting closer to the fragments drain fatigue unless PC is under the effect of a silence spell
- Finding a fragment sends PC back to the cave? (one-way trip until the fragment is found)
- When/how PC realises they've moved through time as well as space. >> Do we show the Halls now and/or then, the desert now and/or then?
- PC gets a minor understanding of time (chronomancy)
