MOD IDEA SO FAR
# Synopsis:
> In the second era, a few years after the dismantling of the Numidium (or ambiguous dragon-break weirdness), a Khajiit scavenger finds his way to the ruined Halls of Colossus. Having slipped past the Blades who guard the area, inside he finds a treasure - a strange piece of metal that distorts the space around it. Thinking it's his lucky break, he snatches the artifact, only to find that when he looks up the ruins around him have changed. Previously open passages are now flooded in sand, walls that were solid are now rubble. The artifact has lost its a strange aura. Not quite understanding what had happened he begins the treacherous journey back to Rimmen to find a buyer.
> Fast forward to the present; He never managed to sell the artifact - without the aura it appeared to be a useless piece of metal. Not only that but the city he returned to had completely changed, everyone and everything he knew was gone. His usual contacts apparently long dead. He had somehow slipped hundreds of years into the future, and anyone he told the story to called him mad or a fraud.
With nothing else to go on, he decides to travel to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators, hoping these people to be more inclined toward believing his story.

A piece of Numidium found its way to Vvardenfell, creating a time wound, similar to the one in the Hall of Colossus.

The time wound whacks time, and everything around it ages/decays

The player needs to restore the piece to its time and place to stop the decay caused by the time wound.

# Part 1: Intro
>While exploring the Grazelands(?) you comes across an area in an otherwise lush zone that appears to be cursed and decaying. Following the visuals leads to the entrance of a slavers cave. Inside the effects are worse, most of the slavers have prematurely aged and died, similar effects are visible on the flora. You interrogate one of the few survivors and he blames the curse on a recently captured Khajiit.
Exploring further into the cave you find said Khajiit, who doesn't make a lot of sense, but you gather that he had an artifact of Dwemer origin that may be the cause of all this. The best of the stolen loot was taken to the lead slaver's quarters, so you make your way there to find the artifact. The curse becomes increasingly more apparent the closer you get, until the final chamber is flooded with sand unlike anything normally seen in Vvardenfell.
You finally find the artifact, partially submerged in sand, and surrounded by strange distortions in the air (You may find the Khajiit's journal here as well). When you take the artifact the distortions disperse and you feel the air change. You look around and find yourself suddenly surrounded by desert.
- PC is sent to check on a slaver's base of operation OR stumbles on the cave. Some of the decay is seeping out of the cave.
- A Khajiit is hiding near the cave and force-greets  PC: slavers captured him and all his belongings, he managed to escape by sheer luck but is as good as dead without his bags.
- Inside, plants and creatures are dead, well, aged, with tons of dried-up roots and shrivelled shrooms (for example.
- PC finds a rift, the closer they get to the rift the slower they are (G7 to the rescue scripting this?) There is sand around the rift, a shimmering image of a desert can be seen through it.
- PC finds the Khajiit's bag that includes a journal.
> Mohamargo found his way to the desolate Halls of Colossus. Mohamargo managed to slip past the Blades who guarded the area, driven by curiosity and hope. Inside these ancient ruins, Mohamargo stumbled upon a treasure - a bizarre piece of metal that seemed to distort the very space around it. It glistened with an otherworldly aura, and in Mohamargo's eyes, it promised unimaginable riches. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, this one dared to snatch the artifact.
But when Mohamargo looked up, the world around him had transformed. Previously open passages were now buried under a sea of sand, and the once solid walls lay in heaps of rubble. The artifact Mohamargo had clutched had lost its strange aura. This one was baffled, unable to grasp what had just transpired.
With the perplexing relic in his paws, Mohamargo began the arduous journey back to Rimmen, determined to find a buyer. Little did this one know that this journey would be the start of an unbelievable odyssey. His return to Rimmen was met with shock and dismay - the city Mohamargo remembered had vanished. Everyone and everything this one once knew had disappeared into the annals of history. His usual contacts, the merchants and traders, had apparently long perished.
Desperate to share his bewildering tale, Mohamargo tried to explain his situation to anyone who would listen. But they either regarded him as a madman or a charlatan. Frustration and loneliness gnawed at this one, and it became painfully clear that Mohamargo was alone in this predicament.
Mohamargo resolved to embark on a daring journey to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators. Perhaps there, among those who understood the intricacies of time and space, this one would find someone willing to believe his extraordinary story. And so, with hope and uncertainty as his companions, Mohamargo set forth on this quest, his life forever changed by the mysterious artifact from the Halls of Colossus.
- a dying (very old-looking slavers) explains they found an object in the Khajiit's bag but as soon as they held it, there was a bang and a glow (or something), when they came to the Khajiit was gone and decay had appeared.

We need:
- a decayed + a shifting version of vanilla GZ/AC flora and fauna
- a cave in the Grazelands/ Azura Coast where decay is more intense as PC nears the Numidium piece and the time wound.
- a shifting portal

# Part 2: Time wound?
- PC talks to the Khajiit, who expresses his confusion about how things are in Vvardenfell, they are not quite as he remembers them.
- The Khajiit thinks the magic of the fragment has awoken since he got in Vvardenfell, he had hoped to sell it but he was captured by the slavers. The description of the decay reminds him of the decay in the Halls where he found the fragment. The answers must be on the other side of the rift

# Part 3 : the desert and oasis (G7's notes on the plot)
>You start exploring the desert and soon spot an imposing ruin in the distance. With nothing else on the horizon, it's the only place to go.
Not far from said ruins a group of armed soldiers stop you. Apparently you're deep within a restricted area, a desert of Elseweyr annexed by the Empire. The soldiers ask you unusual questions that eventually reveal you're not only in a different province, but a different time as well.
The conversation progresses and you learn about the Halls of Colossus, and the "time-wounds" within. These Blades sole job is to make sure none of the artifacts or afflicted make it out of the desert. You can either fight them or agree to return the artifact back to where it was taken.
- In the desert you get accosted by some Blades who demand to know how you got here.
- They think you're a smuggler: many have tried to find valuables in the Halls.
- You get some dialogue where you can figure out timelines are funky (?)
- PC **somehow** gets away from the Blades and makes their way to the Numidium where another rift is open.

# Part 4: The Halls
>Delve into the Halls of Colossus. Do puzzles, fight monsters, learn chronomancy. Eventually return your piece of the Numidium to it's rightful place (and time). Somewhere along the journey you encounter the past version of our Khajiit smuggler and convince him stealing from this place is a bad idea (or kill him). Doing so repairs the timeline and warps you back to the slaver cave, which along with the surrounding lands is now reborn free of decay.
- Through the rift and into the future!
- Using the fragment, PC is able to see/be in the Halls in the past
- In the end you reach the place where the artifact was taken, and you find the khajiit there to steal it again, and you can convince him not to.
- Then you take another time-wound back to the present time and now history is rewritten and he never stole it, wasn't captured/etc.
