MOD IDEA SO FAR
# Synopsis (maybe!):
A piece of Numidium found its way to Vvardenfell, creating a time wound, similar to the one in the Hall of Colossus.

The time wound whacks time, and everything around it ages/decays

The player needs to restore the piece to its time and place to stop the decay caused by the time wound.

# Part 1: Intro
- PC is sent to check on a slaver's base of operation OR stumbles on the cave. Some of the decay is seeping out of the cave.
- A Khajiit is hiding near the cave and force-greets  PC: slavers captured him and all his belongings, he managed to escape by sheer luck but is as good as dead without his bags.
- Inside, plants and creatures are dead, well, aged, with tons of dried-up roots and shrivelled shrooms (for example.
- PC finds a rift, the closer they get to the rift the slower they are (G7 to the rescue scripting this?) There is sand around the rift, a shimmering image of a desert can be seen through it.
- PC finds the Khajiit's bag that includes a journal.
> In the second era, a few years after the dismantling of the Numidium (or ambiguous dragon-break weirdness), a Khajiit scavenger finds his way to the ruined Halls of Colossus. Having slipped past the Blades who guard the area, inside he finds a treasure - a strange piece of metal that distorts the space around it. Thinking it's his lucky break, he snatches the artifact, only to find that when he looks up the ruins around him have changed. Previously open passages are now flooded in sand, and walls that were solid are now rubble. The artifact has lost its a strange aura. Not quite understanding what had happened he begins the treacherous journey back to Rimmen to find a buyer.
Fast forward to the present; He never managed to sell the artifact - without the aura it appeared to be a useless piece of metal. Not only that but the city he returned to had completely changed, everyone and everything he knew was gone. His usual contacts apparently long dead. He had somehow slipped hundreds of years into the future, and anyone he told the story to called him mad or a fraud.
With nothing else to go on, he decides to travel to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators, hoping these people to be more inclined toward believing his story.
- a dying (very old-looking slavers) explains they found an object in the Khajiit's bag but as soon as they held it, there was a bang and a glow (or something), when they came to the Khajiit was gone and decay had appeared.

We need:
- a decayed + a shifting version of vanilla GZ/AC flora and fauna
- a cave in the Grazelands/ Azura Coast where decay is more intense as PC nears the Numidium piece and the time wound.
- a shifting portal

# Part 2: Time wound?
- PC talks to the Khajiit, who expresses his confusion about how things are in Vvardenfell, they are not quite as he remembers them.
- The Khajiit thinks the magic of the fragment has awoken since he got in Vvardenfell, he had hoped to sell it but he was captured by the slavers. The description of the decay reminds him of the decay in the Halls where he found the fragment. The answers must be on the other side of the rift

# Part 3 : the desert and oasis (G7's notes on the plot)
- Slavers captured the scavenger and his artifact. It's "decay"ing their cave, people, and the surrounding lands.
- PC hears rumors about this, or just happens to find the strange exterior and decides to investigate.
- Inside you meet the few surviving slavers, learn a bit of backstory + visual storytelling of decay.
- Ultimately learn about the last slave they captured and go find him.
- He tells you about the artifact, maybe he's a bit mad by now and story doesn't sound believable. 
- You go and check it out, and when you touch the artifact are teleported to Elsewyre.
- In the desert you get accosted by some Blades who demand to know how you got here.
- They think you're a smuggler: many have tried to find valuables in the Halls.
- You get some dialogue where you can figure out timelines are funky (?)
- PC **somehow** gets away from the Blades and makes their way to the Numidium where another rift is open.

# Part 4: The Halls
- Through the rift and into the future!
- Using the fragment, PC is able to see/be in the Halls in the past
- In the end you reach the place where the artifact was taken, and you find the khajiit there to steal it again, and you can convince him not to.
- Then you take another time-wound back to the present time and now history is rewritten and he never stole it, wasn't captured/etc.
