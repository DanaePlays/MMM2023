# Synopsis

>An accidental time traveler brings a shard of the original Numidium to Vvardenfell. This causes a "time-wound", afflicting the surrounding lands and people with premature ageing and death. To cure this wound and restore the lands you'll have to travel to the past and return the shard to its correct place/time - the Halls of Colossus in the deserts of Elseweyr.

# Backstory

>In the [second era](writing/timeline), a Khajiit scavenger sneaks into the Halls of Colossus. Inside, having slipped the Blades who occupy the area, he spots a treasure - a strange piece of metal that distorts the space around it. Thinking it's his lucky break, he snatches the artifact, only to find that when he looks up the ruins around him have changed. Previously open passages are now flooded in sand, walls that were solid are now rubble. The artifact has lost its a strange aura. Not quite understanding what had happened he begins the treacherous journey back to Rimmen to find a buyer.
>
>Fast forward to the present; He never managed to sell the artifact - without the aura it appeared to be a useless piece of metal. Not only that but the city he returned to had completely changed, everyone and everything he knew was gone. His usual contacts apparently long dead. He had somehow slipped hundreds of years into the future, and anyone he told the story to called him mad or a fraud.
>
>With nothing else to go on, he decides to travel to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators, hoping these people to be more inclined toward believing his story.

# Part 2: The desert
>You start exploring the desert and soon spot an imposing building in the distance. With nothing else on the horizon, it's the only place to go.
>
>Not far from said [building](reference%20art/AR-quest-The_Halls_of_Colossus.jpg) a group of armed soldiers stop you. Apparently, you're deep within a restricted area, a desert of Elseweyr annexed by the Empire. The soldiers are convinced you are a thief: after all noone ventures this far in the desert unless they are curious about the Halls.
>
>You are promptly arrested and put in jail... from which you'll escape, and find your way into the Halls, maybe even a way back home.

# Part 3: The Halls
>Delve into the Halls of Colossus. Do puzzles, fight monsters, learn chronomancy. Eventually, you encounter the past version of our Khajiit smuggler and relay the TG order to abort the mission/warn him the Blades are right behind you. Maho agrees to leave without the fragment. Doing so repairs the timeline and warps you back to the smugglers' cave, which along with the surrounding lands is now reborn free of decay.

TL;DR...
- The main dungeon crawl.

We need...

- Above ground and below ground interiors.
- Ideas and scripting for chronomancy magic.
- Dungeon encounters involving multiple timelines.
- (Bonus) Custom "radioactive" creatures to fight.
- Dialogue for the Khajiit (re)-encounter.
- Scripting to restore the decay after our return.
