# Synopsis

>An accidental time traveler brings a shard of the original Numidium to Vvardenfell. This causes a "time-wound", afflicting the surrounding lands and people with premature aging and death. To cure this wound and restore the lands you'll have to travel to the past and return the shard to it's correct place/time - the Halls of Colossus in the deserts of Elseweyr.

# Backstory

>In the [second era](writing/timeline), a Khajiit scavenger sneaks into the Halls of Colossus. Inside, having slipped the Blades who occupy the area, he spots a treasure - a strange piece of metal that distorts the space around it. Thinking it's his lucky break, he snatches the artifact, only to find that when he looks up the ruins around him have changed. Previously open passages are now flooded in sand, walls that were solid are now rubble. The artifact has lost its a strange aura. Not quite understanding what had happened he begins the treacherous journey back to Rimmen to find a buyer.
>
>Fast forward to the present; He never managed to sell the artifact - without the aura it appeared to be a useless piece of metal. Not only that but the city he returned to had completely changed, everyone and everything he knew was gone. His usual contacts apparently long dead. He had somehow slipped hundreds of years into the future, and anyone he told the story to called him mad or a fraud.
>
>With nothing else to go on, he decides to travel to Vvardenfell, the homeland of Numidium's creators, hoping these people to be more inclined toward believing his story.

# Part 1: Intro

>While exploring the Grazelands(?) you comes across an area in an otherwise lush zone that appears to be cursed and decaying. Following the visuals leads to the entrance of a slavers cave. Inside the effects are worse, most of the slavers have prematurely aged and died, similar effects are visible on the flora. You interrogate one of the few survivors and he blames the curse on a recently captured Khajiit.
>
>Exploring further into the cave you find said Khajiit, who doesn't make a lot of sense, but you gather that he had an artifact of Dwemer origin that may be the cause of all this. The best of the stolen loot was taken to the lead slaver's quarters, so you make your way there to find the artifact. The curse becomes increasingly more apparent the closer you get, until the final chamber is flooded with sand unlike anything normally seen in Vvardenfell.
>
>You finally find the artifact, partially submerged in sand, and surrounded by strange distortions in the air (You may find the Khajiit's journal here as well). When you take the artifact the distortions disperse and you feel the air change. You look around and find yourself suddenly surrounded by desert.

TL;DR...
- You discover (or follows rumors to) a cursed slaver cave. 
- Decay is seeping out of the entrance.
- Inside, plants and inhabitants are decaying, dead, or dying. 
- The closer to the artifact the worse the situation gets.
- You can find the Khajiit's belongings, which potentially includes a [journal](writing/journal.md).

We need...
- A slaver cave in the Grazelands.
- Decaying variants of appropriate flora and fauna assets.
- Dialogue for our Khajiit and potentially any other survivors.
- Unique textured Elseweyr sand assets.
- Assets for the artifact itself.
- Distortion VFX shaders.

# Part 2: The desert
>You start exploring the desert and soon spot an imposing ruin in the distance. With nothing else on the horizon, it's the only place to go.
>
>Not far from said ruins a group of armed soldiers stop you. Apparently you're deep within a restricted area, a desert of Elseweyr annexed by the Empire. The soldiers ask you unusual questions that eventually reveal you're not only in a different province, but a different time as well.
>
>The conversation progresses and you learn about the Halls of Colossus, and the "time-wounds" within. These Blades sole job is to make sure none of the artifacts or afflicted make it out of the desert. You can either fight them or agree to return the artifact back to where it was taken.

TL;DR...
- You are teleported to a desert in Elseweyr.
- You meet the Blades who inhabit the area.
- You learn you've also went back in time.
- You travel onward to the Halls of Colossus.

We need...
- A desert landscape.
- Appropriate flora, rocks, and so on.
- Dialogue for the soldiers.
- Exterior assets for the Halls of Colossus.

# Part 3: The Halls
>Delve into the Halls of Colossus. Do puzzles, fight monsters, learn chronomancy. Eventually return your piece of the Numidium to it's rightful place (and time). Somewhere along the journey you encounter the past version of our Khajiit smuggler and convince him stealing from this place is a bad idea (or kill him). Doing so repairs the timeline and warps you back to the slaver cave, which along with the surrounding lands is now reborn free of decay.

TL;DR...
- The main dungeon crawl.

We need...
- The outdoor exterior.
- Above ground and below ground interiors.
- Ideas and scripting for chronomancy magic.
- Dungeon encounters involving multiple timelines.
- (Bonus) Custom "radioactive" creatures to fight.
- Dialogue for the Khajiit (re)-encounter.
- Scripting to restore the decay after our return.
